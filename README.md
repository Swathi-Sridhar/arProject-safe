# arProject-safe
Ar for medical education.

To run:
  On the desktop:
    You have to go to the folder with all the files and run a simple HTTP server using python.
      1. Install python. Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/
      2. Go to the folder. For example, if it is on the desktop and is named AR-medicine, in the command promt type,
          $cd /Desktop/AR-medicine
      3. Run the command
          $python -m SimpleHTTPServer
          to create a local server. By default it is configured to listen to port 8000. So go to "localhost:8000" to view the project.
      4. Give access to the camera. Hold a Hiro marker in front of it to see the AR. Navigate and press the control buttons to see it in            action. 
      
   On you phone:
    1. The project has been hosted on Surge(https://surge.sh/), which provides free websites. So you can also give a demo on your phone. Go        to the link https://medical-ar-seminar.surge.sh on your phone. Take care that it is always https and not http. 
    2. Use a Hiro marker again to view the organs.
